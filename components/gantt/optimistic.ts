/**
 * Re-running the schedule in the browser so a drag lands immediately.

 * A drag ends by writing to the server, but dnd-kit drops its transform the moment the pointer
 * is released — so without this the bar snaps back to where it started and only jumps forward
 * once the refetch arrives. `computeSchedule` is pure and shared with the server, which is what
 * makes an honest preview possible: the same code, the same rules, so the optimistic placement
 * is what the round trip will confirm rather than a guess that has to be corrected.
 *
 * Cascades come along for free — moving a predecessor moves everything derived from it here,
 * exactly as it will on the server.
