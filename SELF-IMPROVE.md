# Self-improvement backlog

Each entry starts with a count of how many times the problem has been hit. The
list is **sorted by that count, highest first** — the top of the file is what
this repo pays for most often, and that is the order to fix things in.

An entry is one problem with one fix. When you hit something, look below
first. Bump an entry's count (`1x` → `2x`) only where its fix, had it been
made, would have prevented what you just hit; add what the new instance
taught, and move the entry up to its place. Anything else is a new entry at
`1x`, at the end of the `1x` run, however much it resembles one already here
— a resemblance is not a recurrence, and a count that grows on resemblance
puts a family of small problems above the one the repo pays for most. An
entry whose remedy has landed comes off the list.

Entries live under a heading per count (`## 2x`, `## 1x`), highest first, each
a checkbox whose bold opening sentence names the problem and whose rest names
the fix:

```markdown
## 1x

- [ ] **One sentence naming the problem.** What it cost, and the change to
      the repo that would have prevented it.
```

This is not the issue tracker. A bug or feature in the product belongs in a
GitHub issue. An entry here is about the work itself: something in the code
structure, tooling, tests, docs or diagnostics that made a task slower or more
confusing than it needed to be, and that will do so again.

## 1x

- [ ] **A `null`-target guard written for a dialog's confirm handler is
      unreachable, and 100% statement coverage only says so after a full
      `check-all`.** Five call sites each needed rewriting once the coverage
      gate rejected them, a wasted full run. The pattern that has no
      unreachable line — render the dialog inside `{target && (…)}` and read
      the target in the handler closure — belongs in `AGENTS.md` next to the
      coverage rules, and in `components/ui/ConfirmDialog.tsx`'s own usage
      note.
