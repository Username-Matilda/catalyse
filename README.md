## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- **Email**: Resend SDK
- **Auth**: Custom token-based + Google OAuth
- **Hosting**: Railway

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- npm
- A PostgreSQL 18 server. `docker compose up -d` starts one matching CI and production; a
  native install (Homebrew, apt, Postgres.app) works too — set `DATABASE_URL` accordingly.
  `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` are needed for `fetch-prod-db` and the backup job; `local-setup`
  installs them if missing (`npm run install:pg-tools`: Homebrew on macOS, apt/dnf/pacman/apk on Linux).

### Installation

```bash
npm run local-setup
```

This installs dependencies, Playwright browsers and the Postgres client tools, restores a copy of production into your database (anonymised), and runs migrations. Postgres must be running first.

### Environment

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Key variables:

- `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection URL (e.g. `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/catalyse`)
- `RESEND_API_KEY` — for email sending
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` — for Google OAuth
- `STUB_EMAIL=true` — suppress real emails in development

### Running

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### First-Time Setup

To make yourself an admin, add your email to `.env.local`:

```env
ADMIN_EMAILS=your@email.com
```

On next login, the app will automatically grant admin access. Multiple emails can be comma-separated.

## Database & Migrations

### Local dev database

The local dev database is a copy of prod, restored into whatever `DATABASE_URL` points at. Refresh it with:

```bash
npm run fetch-prod-db && npm run migrate
```

`fetch-prod-db` downloads the latest prod `pg_dump` from B2, **drops and recreates the `public` schema** of the target database, and restores into it. It then runs the same scrub as `anonymise-db` (PII replaced, dev accounts seeded) and empties the database again if that fails, so raw prod data is never left behind. Every account gets the same known password, so an anonymised copy must not sit behind a public URL. `anonymise-db` alone re-scrubs a database that is already restored. `scripts/anonymise-columns.ts` records how each text column is treated, and a test fails when a new column is missing from it. Both scripts refuse to run when `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_NAME=production`, and `fetch-prod-db` refuses in any Railway environment unless `ALLOW_DB_RESTORE=1` is set (set it only on the preview base environment). `migrate` runs `prisma migrate deploy`, which applies any unapplied migration files in order without drift-checking.

Unit tests create a throwaway schema per test file (`vitest_*`) in the same database, and e2e workers use `e2e_<n>`; neither touches `public`.

### Adding a migration

Do **not** use `prisma migrate dev` — it checks for schema drift against the live DB and will fail. The correct workflow:

1. Edit `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Generate the migration file:
   ```bash
   npm run new-migration your_migration_name
   ```
   This creates `prisma/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_your_migration_name/migration.sql` with the diff SQL.
3. **Review the generated SQL** — the diff may include unrelated pending changes from other branches. Remove any statements not relevant to your change.
4. Apply it:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```
5. Regenerate the Prisma client:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

## Maintenance mode

Super admins can take the site down from **Admin → Platform Settings → Maintenance mode**. Everyone else then sees a "down for maintenance" page and every API call except signing in or out is refused with a 503. Super admins (emails in `ADMIN_EMAILS`) can still log in at `/login` and use the whole site as normal, with a banner at the top of every page reminding them it is on; switch the toggle off there to bring the site back.

## Testing

### Running tests

```bash
npm run test:unit       # Run unit tests only (vitest)
npm run test:e2e        # Run e2e tests only (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e:headed # Run with a visible browser (single worker, slowed)
npm run test:e2e:ui     # Open Playwright UI mode
```

Tests spin up an isolated Next.js server with a fresh database — your dev server doesn't need to be running.

The `test:e2e:dev` variants skip the build and use a dev server instead. These are for interactive development only — do not use them to verify correctness, as they skip type checking and build validation.

### CI workflow checks

The repo is public, so pull requests from forks run `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with untrusted code. GitHub gives such runs a read-only token and no repository secrets; the workflow is written so it never needs either, and two checks keep it that way:

- **[zizmor](https://docs.zizmor.sh/)** runs in the `static-checks` job and fails on dangerous triggers, template injection, unpinned actions, broad permissions and leaked credentials. Run it locally with `uvx zizmor .github/workflows/` (needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)).
- **`test/ci-workflow.test.ts`** (part of `npm run test:unit`) checks the project-specific rules zizmor can't know: only `push`/`pull_request` triggers, no `secrets.*` anywhere, read-only permissions, GitHub-hosted runners, every `*_URL` pointing at `localhost`, and every credential-shaped variable holding a literal dummy.

Actions are pinned to commit SHAs with the version in a trailing comment; bump both together.
