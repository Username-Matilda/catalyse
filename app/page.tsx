            PauseAI is a civic movement, which means that we help citizens organise to take
            collective actions and make their voice heard. Our volunteers engage with their MPs
            about AI safety, march in protests, join conferences about AI safety in the European and
            UK Parliaments and gather signatures for open letters.

            PauseAI is focused on the risks of superhuman AI. This focus is the thing that is unique
