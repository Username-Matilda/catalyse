            <h4>What we collect</h4>
            <ul className="list-disc text-text-light mb-4 pl-5">
              <li>Information you provide (name, email, bio, contact details)</li>
              <li>Skills and availability you share</li>
              <li>Projects you propose or express interest in</li>
              <li>Bug reports and feedback you submit</li>
              <li>Admin notes about your volunteering activity (visible to admins only)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Legal basis for processing</h4>
            <p className="text-text-light">We process your data based on:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc text-text-light mb-4 pl-5">
              <li>
                <strong>Consent</strong> — for sharing your profile with other volunteers and
                allowing project owners to contact you (you can withdraw consent at any time via
                your profile settings)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legitimate interest</strong> — for operating the platform, matching
                volunteers with projects, platform administration, and sending inactivity reminders
                to volunteers who have claimed a task
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Contract performance</strong> — for providing you the service you signed up
                for
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>How we use it</h4>
            <ul className="list-disc text-text-light mb-4 pl-5">
              <li>To match you with relevant projects based on your skills</li>
              <li>To enable project owners to contact you (with your consent)</li>
              <li>
                To send you transactional emails (password resets, admin invites, welcome emails)
              </li>
              <li>
                To relay messages between volunteers via email (the sender&apos;s email is included
                as reply-to so you can respond directly)
              </li>
              <li>To send you notifications about your projects and interests</li>
              <li>
                To send automated inactivity reminders if you are assigned to a task and have not
                posted an update for a period of time, and to automatically unassign you from the
                task after continued inactivity so that other volunteers can take it on. Project
                owners and admins are notified when a volunteer is unassigned due to inactivity
                (legitimate interest basis — keeping projects moving)
              </li>
              <li>
                To notify project owners and admins when task updates are posted, so they can stay
                informed about progress
              </li>
              <li>For platform administration and volunteer coordination</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What we don&apos;t do</h4>
            <ul className="list-disc text-text-light mb-4 pl-5">
              <li>We never sell your data</li>
              <li>We don&apos;t share your contact info without your consent</li>
              <li>
                We don&apos;t use your data for profiling or to make decisions that have legal or
                significant effects on you. Automated task unassignment due to inactivity is a minor
                operational measure to keep projects moving — it does not affect your account,
                profile, or ability to claim other tasks
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Third-party data processors</h4>
            <p className="text-text-light">
              The following services process data on our behalf (as data processors under GDPR
              Article 28). We have assessed each for adequate data protection safeguards:

            <ul className="list-disc text-text-light mb-4 pl-5">
              <li>
                <strong>Railway</strong> (hosting) — our application and database are hosted on
                Railway&apos;s cloud infrastructure. Data may be processed in the United States. We
                rely on Railway&apos;s standard contractual safeguards for international transfers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Resend</strong> (email delivery) — used to send transactional emails
                (password resets, welcome emails, admin invites) and relay messages between
                volunteers. Resend processes your email address and name for delivery purposes only.
                Data may be processed in the United States.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Backblaze B2</strong> (encrypted backups) — daily encrypted backups of the
                database are stored in Backblaze&apos;s EU data centre (Amsterdam). Backups are
                retained for 30 days and then automatically deleted. Backups are used solely for
                disaster recovery and are never accessed for any other purpose.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Google Analytics</strong> (usage analytics) — used to understand how the
                platform is used so we can improve it. Collects anonymised page view and interaction
                data via cookies. IP addresses are anonymised. Only loaded if you accept cookies via
                the consent banner. You can withdraw consent at any time by clearing your browser

                States.

              <li>
                <strong>Google Sign-In</strong> (authentication) — if you choose to sign in with
                Google, Google verifies your identity and shares your name and email with us to
                create or log into your account. No other Google data is accessed.

            </ul>
            <p className="text-text-light mb-4">
              Where data is processed outside the UK/EEA, we rely on the service provider&apos;s
              standard contractual clauses and data processing agreements as safeguards for
              international transfers.

            <ul className="list-disc text-text-light mb-4 pl-5">
              <li>Active accounts: data is kept as long as your account is active</li>
              <li>
                Deleted accounts: personal data is anonymised immediately upon deletion. Anonymised
                records (e.g. &ldquo;[Deleted User]&rdquo; on project history) are retained for
                platform integrity
              </li>
              <li>
                Database backups: retained for 30 days, then automatically deleted. When you delete
                your account, your data is anonymised in the live database immediately; backup
                copies containing pre-deletion data will be overwritten within 30 days
              </li>
              <li>Password reset tokens expire after 1 hour</li>
              <li>Admin invite tokens expire after 7 days</li>

              <li>
                <strong>Essential cookies</strong> — we use localStorage (not cookies) to store your
                login session and preferences (dark mode, cookie consent choice). These are
                necessary for the site to function.

                anonymised usage data. These are only loaded after you accept the cookie consent
                banner. You can decline or withdraw consent at any time.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Security</h4>
            <p className="text-text-light">
              Passwords are hashed using PBKDF2-SHA256 with random salts and are never stored in
              plain text. All data is transmitted over HTTPS. Authentication uses secure random
              tokens. Database backups are encrypted at rest by Backblaze and transmitted over
              HTTPS. Access to backups requires API credentials that are stored securely as
              environment variables.
